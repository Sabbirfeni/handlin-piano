          <div class="testimonial-text">Excellent customer service! He came out and once realizing we had just moved the piano from my grandmothers house, suggested waiting a week before we did the pitch raise and tuning. He came to the house the next week and worked on our piano. He did an excellent job explaining different things about my piano and sound. Made some suggestions for cleaning and future tune ups. I asked about a couple of the stuck keys and he said he didn't have the right supplies with him to do it right then but today called while he was in the neighborhood and came by and fixed the stuck keys, free of charge.  Over all I am very impressed and would highly recommend him. Very professional.
